Language Design
===============

Design for on object oriented language for the modern age.

Core principles:

* Structs ("Objects" with copy on write)

  * Are they allowed to define methods?

  * Are inline validations allowed?

  * Assign Validators to fields

  * How do we want to implement autoboxing (/ weak typing)?

* Scalar types

  * Work like structs, is there a differentiation required?

  * Weak typing (string to integer) MUST work somehow. Conversions of complex
    types should work alike.

* Classes

  * Fields on defined dependencies, no scalar "properties" allowed

  * Fields are automatically initialized

    * If multiple implementations of a type exist (no defined auto-wiring) we
      require dependency configuration, how should that look like?

  * Interfaces

    * Just as always

  * Abstract classes

    * Work just like interfaces, no concrete methods allowed

* Side effects

  * All side effects must be explicit (output, exceptions, global scope
    modifications).

    * In development mode side effects are allowed (debugging output), in
      production mode there will be "warnings".

  * Pure methods (functions) are preferred (they are distributable (accross
    threads, CPUs, machines, …))

* Asynchronous IO

  * Simple with pure functions. Wanted side effects / join points via messaging
    / promises?

I could not care less…

Compilation Target
==================

What would be the best compilation target for such a language?

* Java Bytecode

* asm.js

* Erlang

* C

* …?
